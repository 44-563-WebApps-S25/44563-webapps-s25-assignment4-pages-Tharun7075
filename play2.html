        <p class="speech">There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
        And though that nature with a beauteous wall
        Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
        I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
        With this thy fair and outward character.
        I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
        Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
        For such disguise as haply shall become
        The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
        Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
        It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
        And speak to him in many sorts of music
        That will allow me very worth his service.
        What else may hap to time I will commit;
        Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</p>
    
       <h4 class="Captain"> Captain</h4> 
        <p class="speech">Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
        When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</p>
    <h4 class="viola">VIOLA</h4>
        <p class="speech">I thank thee: lead me on.</p>
